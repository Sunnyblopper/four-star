                    FUJA is very good.The machine is really duration. At least&#39; in a day I use
                    the machine for like 20hours and this is still looking fresh and clean. I love
                    FUJA. I maintain this machine well. I want to be an ambassador of FUJA. I
                    don&#39;t mind how long it takes me to get there. I&#39;ll surely be. I love the
                    machine and I love the job too. Thanks!

                    We are satisfied with our new machine &quot;FJ1501CS Embroidery Machine&quot;. I
                    did a ton of research before buying an embroidery machine and FUJA was
                    definitely the best option. The machine arrived before the estimated time, the
                    manuals and video tutorials are excellent for beginners even without experience.
                    And, what we liked the most, the entire FUJA team is always aware of everything
                    that is being done, helping at every step. In a week we already had everything
                    ready and working with the machine. Quality, experience, guarantee and the best
                    support with the best team is the experience we have had. Thank you so much!

                    This is my third embroidery machine. I can maintain my FUJA myself. Plus the
                    cost was about half what I paid for my top of the line. If I run into trouble I
                    can send a text and get help I&#39;ve always received an answer in less than
                    three hours. Who does that, FUJA does. Recently Lucy and the engineer Mr. Yin
                    helped me solve a problem I was having. They told me what to do showed me
                    videos, ones that I had watched before trying to figure this out myself but they
                    gave me pointers that made all the difference and confidence that I could do it.
                    Thanks!

                    Machine delivered in excellent condition and was very well packaged. Putting the
                    base together is pretty straightforward. I was able to assemble it on my own.
                    Have been very thoroughly training myself with videos via YouTube as well the
                    manual that comes with it. I am taking my time to understand all the facets of
                    it because it is a large investment. The support staff has been fantastic.
                    Although I haven&rsquo;t personally needed one-on-one help thus far, I have been
                    watching social media posts of others with questions and the turn around time
                    from FUJA seems great. You will need to purchase software for it. Would highly
                    recommend this machine to anyone that may be uncertain of it versus other
                    machines.

                    Very happy with this purchase. I have previous experience with single head
                    embroidery machine but was ready to upgrade. This machine is as impressive as
                    pictured. I like the green color. It has not disappointed and has ran great
                    since day one. When I placed the order, I was immediately set up with a support
                    person who kept me updated through the shipping process and has been there for
                    me since. She has been very responsive. I was worried about the time difference
                    but so far it hasn&#39;t been a problem. I would definitely buy again in the
                    future.

                    I&#39;m not new to the world of embroidery. After a ton of research, I decided
                    to purchase the FUJA 15 needles embroidery machine. The item arrived nicely
                    packaged and secure in a crate. There weren&#39;t any damaged or missing items.
                    There are plenty of instructional videos online. It was simple to put together
                    after watching the video. I&#39;ve stitched a few projects with ease using
                    different brands of thread. The machine hasn&#39;t shredded any brands of thread
                    I&#39;ve tested. The variable speed feature is a great plus!
